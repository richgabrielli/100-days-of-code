# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Planning on what my 100 days will look like.

**Thoughts:** I will be on Day 0 until I have a framework. What do I want to learn and how? Tutorials or Project or both?

My best time to think is while running. During my 5 mile run today during lunch, I was thinking of project ideas and came up with:
  * Phase 1 - Swift iOS app that interfaces HealthKit
  * Phase 2 - Build OpenSource API on GitHub for for HealthKit access.
  * Phase 3 - Way to use Vapor for backend?

  No clue how long this will take, but will add more if needed.
